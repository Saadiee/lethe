# Lethe
Cryptographic erasure via irreversible key destruction

Lethe is a cryptographic erasure tool that renders data permanently unrecoverable by destroying the cryptographic keys used to encrypt it. The encrypted data may remain intact, but without the key, recovery is computationally infeasible.
